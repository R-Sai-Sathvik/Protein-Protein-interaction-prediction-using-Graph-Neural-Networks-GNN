# Protein-Protein-interaction-prediction-using-Graph-Neural-Networks-GNN
A GNN-based system for predicting Protein-Protein Interactions. It represents proteins as nodes and interactions as edges in a graph, utilizing protein features to estimate interaction likelihood. The system enhances biological research by improving PPI prediction accuracy, aiding drug discovery and functional analysis.
