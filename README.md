# Protein-Protein-interaction-prediction-using-Graph-Neural-Networks-GNN
This repository contains code and models for predicting Protein-Protein Interactions using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Proteins are represented as nodes and interactions as edges in a graph. The model leverages protein features and graph structure to predict interaction likelihood between protein pairs.
